# WinSmtpRelay

> **Work in progress** — This project is under active development and not yet ready for production use.

> **Hosted Service** — We are considering offering WinSmtpRelay as a hosted/managed service. For test environments, we would provide the service free of charge. If you are interested, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ardimedia/winsmtprelay/issues) and let us know about your use case.


Open-source SMTP relay server for Windows. Built with .NET 10, designed as a modern replacement for IIS SMTP.

**Relay only** — no mailboxes, no IMAP, no POP3. Accepts mail from internal apps/devices and forwards it via MX lookup or smart host.

## Features

- Multiple receive connectors (different port/IP/TLS/auth per connector)
- Send connectors with per-domain routing (MX or smart host)
- Store-and-forward message queue (SQLite)
- STARTTLS (port 587) and implicit TLS (port 465)
- SMTP AUTH with per-user SendAs control and rate limits
- DKIM signing, SPF/DMARC verification
- IP-based relay restrictions
- Pickup folder for .eml files
- Blazor admin UI (HTTPS)
- REST API for management and monitoring
- Windows Service with Event Log integration
- MSI installer (WiX v5)

## Solution Structure

```
src/
  WinSmtpRelay.Core          — Domain models, interfaces, configuration
  WinSmtpRelay.SmtpListener  — Inbound SMTP (wraps SmtpServer NuGet)
  WinSmtpRelay.Delivery      — Outbound queue, retry, MailKit sending
  WinSmtpRelay.Security      — TLS, DKIM, SPF, DMARC
  WinSmtpRelay.Storage       — SQLite persistence (EF Core)
  WinSmtpRelay.AdminApi      — REST API (Minimal API, class library)
  WinSmtpRelay.AdminUi       — Blazor Server admin interface (Razor Class Library)
  WinSmtpRelay.Service       — Windows Service host (Kestrel hosts API + UI)

## Configuration

Configuration is split between file-based and database-stored settings:

### appsettings.json (requires restart)

Infrastructure settings the application needs before it can start:

- Kestrel ports and TLS certificate paths
- SQLite database connection string
- Log levels
- Admin UI enabled/disabled, port and bind address (default: `0.0.0.0:8025`)
- Windows Service settings

### SQLite database (runtime-editable via Admin UI)

Everything the admin edits during normal operation:

- Receive connectors (port/IP/TLS/auth)
- Send connectors and domain routing
- Accepted domains
- IP allow/deny lists
- SMTP users and credentials
- DKIM keys and per-domain config
- Rate limits and auto-ban rules
- Message filter rules

The Admin UI reads `appsettings.json` for display but does not write to it.

## Building

```bash
dotnet build winsmtprelay.slnx
dotnet test winsmtprelay.slnx
```

## Running

As a console app (development):

```bash
dotnet run --project src/WinSmtpRelay.Service
```

As a Windows Service:

```bash
sc.exe create WinSmtpRelay binPath="C:\path\to\WinSmtpRelay.Service.exe"
sc.exe start WinSmtpRelay
```
